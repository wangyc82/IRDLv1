IRDLv1 is procedure for identify the regulaoty divergent lncRNA and gene pairs.

It includes the MATLAB code for generation of the 3mer sequence feature from lncRNA/gene nucleic acid sequences (codonComposition.m);
the R code for increasing learning framework (increasing-learning-regDLG.R), and its dependencies: crossvalSVM.R (SVM crossvall validation), and getperf.R; the R code for generation the nucleic acid sequences for lncRNA/gene and their promoters (generate-lncRNA/gene-sequence).

The divergent pairs of lncRNAs and genes for mouse and human are provided to test the IRDL.
